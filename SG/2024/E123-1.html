        <p>123.1 END<br>You journey to the graveyard of airplanes. The God Eye-the<br>portal to your home-swirls in the distant sky.</p>
<p>As the sun wanes and the night frogs begin their chants,<br>Meecra watches you with white eyes from shadows as dark as<br>an ink well.</p>
<p>“The time has come-the portal will close soon. Give me the<br>spear,” she says, striding forward, her feet barely leaving<br>prints on the ground.</p>
<p>Ezarius holds the spear. “You can’t have it,” he says.</p>
<p>“Quit wasting time and give her the spear!” says Miguel.</p>
<p>“He won’t do that,” says Meecra. “You see, he is a Red Heretic.<br>He will only use the spear to destroy the gods. Shorme<br>destroyed his home, and he wants revenge.”</p>
<p>Ezarius looks almost relieved at Meecra’s revelation. His<br>tensed shoulders relax a little.</p>
<p>“How long have you known?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Since we met,” says Meecra. “But it didn’t trouble me. I started<br>the Red Heretics in the first place.”</p>
<p>Ezarius returns an expression of guarded disbelief. “Why<br>would you create something that would weaken you and all<br>the gods?”</p>
<p>Meecra sighs. “I could no longer watch the world suffer. There<br>was too much pain and death and I was willing to put myself<br>in danger to stop it.</p>
<p>“Ages ago, before a great sleep fell upon us, Shorme and<br>Valard destroyed the vast Pann empire. Now only a few pitiful<br>nomads remain. When the gods were awakened eight years<br>ago, they crushed nations in their rage. Shorme killed thousands<br>in the city of Lukra. The gods have lived above mortals<br>for too long. When I discovered the way to weaken them, I<br>had to share it.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell us earlier?” asks Jessie.</p>
<p>“Orfash is already hunting me because I destroyed his temple.<br>If the gods knew my secret, they would destroy me. I only<br>share this with you now because I must.”</p>
<p>Ezarius wears a troubled expression now. “What proof do you<br>have? How can I trust you?”</p>
<p>“The Red Heretics have long kept the secret of how to destroy<br>a totem. They wait to use it when the time is right. But I gave<br>them the secret to begin with. Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” says Ezarius. “But do you?”</p>
<p>“Only the venom of the Hectakron can destroy a totem. And<br>no mortal has ever procured it. Where do you think those<br>vials in your guarded care came from. I gave them to the<br>Heretics.”</p>
<p>Ezarius has no reply. Meecra’s evidence is enough to silence<br>his doubts. But Miguel has other worries.</p>
<p>“You’ve lied to us this whole time,” he says. “How could you<br>so easily betray us?”</p>
<p>“It did not worry me at first. But it has become a heavier burden.<br>If what Meecra says is true, maybe we can all get what<br>we want.”</p>
<p>“To destroy the gods?” asks Miguel.</p>
<p>Ezarius shakes his head. “To destroy them completely is to<br>become like them-cruel, destructive, heartless. I don’t want<br>to murder the gods, but I do expect them to live as equals.”</p>
<p>“And where does that leave us?” you ask.</p>
<p>In a sudden explosion of flame and smoke, Orfash roars,<br>his horns eternally burning, his eyes black with bloodlust.<br>“Shorme! Ohmlude! Where are you?”</p>
<p>Two more gods appear, one of them a short, curly-haired<br>woman with a fishing pole, the other a pale woman with obsidian<br>hair and ember eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s this about?” The short woman swashes the fishing<br>pole in his face. “I have no interest in your little feud with<br>Meecra.”</p>
<p>Orfash snorts. “Listen, Ohmlude, I’ve had my suspicions for<br>weeks, but now I’m certain. I can prove Meecra has been<br>scheming with mortals to betray the gods.” Shorme looks<br>intrigued, watching Meecra with deadly eagerness.</p>
<p>Ohmlude sighs. “Not this again. Why would she do something<br>like that? She’s as weak as the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Orfash stomps the ground with a heavy hoof, sending chunks<br>of rock and dirt in every direction. “Because she’s sided with<br>the mortals! She wants to be one of them. This Lukran she’s<br>working with is a Red Heretic!”</p>
<p>Ohmlude throws down the fishing pole and waddles up to<br>Ezarius, grabbing the edge of his coat and sniffing it. “Yes!<br>Orfash is right. This man has the smell of Hectakron venom on<br>him. It’s in one of his pockets!”</p>
<p>Shorme turns to Meecra, rage in her eyes. “Traitor! How dare<br>you work against us!”</p>
<p>Meecra nods solemnly. “Ezarius, now is the time. Give me the<br>spear. It’s the only way we’ll defeat them.”</p>
<p>Ezarius hesitates, looking from one god to another, then<br>throws the spear toward Meecra. Orfash yells and raises an<br>axe, Shorme shakes the ground with a slammed foot, and<br>Ohmlude picks up her fishing pole. Meecra points the spear<br>at the three of them and they freeze.</p>
<p>“This is the Starspear, and I will destroy you with it,” she says<br>with a solemn expression.</p>
<p>“You wouldn’t dare use it,” snarls Orfash.</p>
<p>“Would I not? After what you’ve all done to the people of this<br>world?”</p>
<p>Ohmlude snaps her fingers suddenly and disappears in a<br>flash. The earth opens and swallows Shorme, and Orfash<br>roars in fury, disappearing in a cloud of smoke.</p>
<p>Meecra chuckles to herself, leaning against the spear. “At least<br>now I can make sure the rest of them behave themselves.” She<br>turns to you. “Claire Smith, the portal is about to close! Take<br>your flying machine and go home.”</p>
<p>Ezarius looks at you with a half-smile tinged with melancholy.<br>“I’m going to miss you all.”</p>
<p>“Take care of yourself, Ezarius,” you say. “And thank you.”</p>
<p>By now, Eugene has the engines roaring. You’re the last one<br>in the plane, and when you climb inside and shut the door,<br>you’re greeted by hopeful and fearful faces.</p>
<p>The plane shudders as it releases its grip on the yellow grass<br>and soars toward the giant face in the mountain and the God<br>Eye. The portal flickers as you grow closer, sputtering with the<br>last moments of its life.</p>
<p>A sudden screech shakes the plane and pierces your ears like<br>a knife. The Helthark’s titanic shadow climbs up the mountain<br>face; you can see it above you. It swoops toward you, eager<br>to dash your plane against the cliffs.</p>
<p>An eerie song drifts over the mountain. The Helthark slows,<br>flapping its wings laboriously. It drifts to the ground with a<br>massive thump, asleep, just as you fly through the swirling<br>mass of the God Eye. Home waits for you on the other side.<br>You can feel your heart racing. Have you finally returned?</p>
<p>Clouds surround the plane. In a gap ahead, something tall and<br>majestic and red stands above a glittering sea; the Golden<br>Gate Bridge welcomes you home.</p>
<p>“We’re back!” Jessie calls, and a cheer erupts in the back of<br>the plane.</p>
<p>Miguel radios the airstrip, and by the time you land, Ruby,<br>Ed’s daughter, is waiting with teary eyes. She runs to Ed and<br>throws her arms around his neck, then dashes to Miguel, covering<br>him with kisses. You jump onto your motorcycle, waving<br>at them, and race away with a burst of speed, already searching<br>for the next adventure.</p>
