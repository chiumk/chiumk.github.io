        <p>114 ~<br>As you fly in, you can see the smoke and flames from abovethe<br>village of Pran is on fire.</p>
<p>Ezarius is unable to take his eyes away from the burning town.<br>“Hurry, please! There are so many people down there!”</p>
<p>But as you rush to the village’s aid, you’re blocked just outside<br>the gates by a group of robed figures, their indistinct bodies<br>bristling with weapons of all sorts. A towering man steps forward.<br>Underneath his hood, he has the face of a bull. When<br>he speaks, his voice is a low rumble.</p>
<p>“Turn back! This village suffers a just punishment for harboring<br>heretics. We will allow no interference.”</p>
<p>Before you have time to respond, Ezarius shouts a curse, pulls<br>out his weapon, and charges forward.</p>

<p>It takes the rest of the night, but working together with the<br>villagers you manage to put out all the fires and chase away<br>the remaining cultists. But Ezarius still looks unsettled. He<br>stares into every face and every corner, looking for something<br>or someone he cannot find.</p>
<p>Jessie watches his continued panic with sympathy. “Is there<br>anything more we can do to help?”</p>
<p>Ezarius looks like he’s about to answer, but he changes his<br>mind, closing himself off again. He turns away. “It’s been a<br>long night and you’ve all done so much already. You should all<br>get some rest. I can keep searching on my own.”</p>
<p>“Nonsense,” says Ed, although he’s visibly exhausted. “If<br>there’s work that still needs to be done, we’ll do it.”</p>

        <p>115 ~<br>As you try to hand out pamphlets to passersby, talking loudly<br>about the evils of King Trusiam, the people of Meriok largely<br>ignore you. Some of them glance at you and roll their eyes<br>before hurrying on. Some of them give you a more sympathetic<br>look, but they still won’t stop to talk to you.</p>
<p>Finally, a young man comes up and claps you on the back.<br>“Hey, folks. We appreciate what you’re doing here, but most<br>of the citizens of Meriok have already heard of us and what<br>we’re doing. Plus, it can be pretty dangerous to openly show<br>interest in the rebellion this close to the city. Here.” The young<br>man takes the stack of fliers from you.</p>
<p>“I’ll put these somewhere where people are more likely to<br>accept them. Secretly, of course. Maybe it will still make a bit<br>of a difference. I know a few fence-sitters who might be interested<br>in what our philosophers have to say. Thanks again for<br>helping out! We appreciate our volunteers, even when they’re<br>a bit misguided.”</p>
<p>As soon as the young man is out of sight, Ed sighs. “That kid<br>sure was condescending. At least we got that humiliating task<br>over with.”</p>

<p>“Fascinating … “ says one of the Lukrans. “Such a primitive<br>form of political dispute. And how are you involved in all<br>this?” This last question was directed towards Ezarius.</p>
<p>“I’m not involved. But I support anyone’s effort to overthrow<br>their oppressors.” Despite his casual affect, there’s a dangerous<br>spark in Ezarius’ eyes.</p>

<p>You journey to the graveyard of airplanes. The God Eye-the<br>portal to your home-swirls in the distant sky.</p>
<p>As the sun wanes and the night frogs begin their chants,<br>Meecra watches you with white eyes from shadows as dark as<br>an ink well.</p>
<p>“The time has come-the portal will close soon. Tell me you<br>have the totems,” she says, striding forward, her feet barely<br>leaving prints on the ground.</p>
<p>“Yes,” you say, digging into your bag. You rummage through<br>bits of rope, matches, and notes, but you can’t find the totems.<br>Jessie pulls out her pockets and badgers Ed and Miguel,<br>but no one has them. A smile gathers at the corner of Meeera’s<br>mouth.</p>
<p>“I know where they are,” she says, looking at Ezarius.</p>
<p>He stares back silently, hesitation in his eyes and on the edge<br>of his tongue.</p>
<p>“Well, then give her the totems,” says Jessie. “I want to go<br>home!”</p>
<p>“I can’t do that,” says Ezarius, now with growing determination.</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Quit wasting time and give her<br>the totems!” says Miguel.</p>
<p>“He won’t do that,” says Meecra. “You see, he is a Red Heretic.<br>He will only use the totems to weaken the gods. Shorme<br>destroyed his home, and he wants revenge.”</p>
<p>Ezarius looks almost relieved at Meecra’s revelation. His<br>tensed shoulders relax a little.</p>
<p>“How long have you known?” he asks.</p>
<p>“Since we met,” says Meecra. “But it didn’t trouble me. I started<br>the Red Heretics in the first place.”</p>
<p>Ezarius returns an expression of guarded disbelief. “Why<br>would you create something that would weaken you and all<br>the gods?”</p>
<p>Meecra sighs. “I could no longer watch the world suffer. There<br>was too much pain and death and I was willing to put myself<br>in danger to stop it.</p>
<p>“Ages ago, before a great sleep fell upon us, Shorme and<br>Valard destroyed the vast Pann empire. Now only a few pitiful<br>nomads remain. When the gods were awakened eight years<br>ago, they crushed nations in their rage. Shorme killed thousands<br>in the city of Lukra. The gods have lived above mortals<br>for too long. When I discovered the way to weaken them, I<br>had to share it.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell us earlier?” asks Jessie.</p>
<p>“Orfash is already hunting me because I destroyed his temple.<br>If the gods knew my secret, they would destroy me. I only<br>share this with you now because I must.”</p>
<p>Ezarius wears a troubled expression now. “What proof do you<br>have? How can I trust you?”</p>
<p>“The Red Heretics have long kept the secret of how to destroy<br>a totem. They wait to use it when the time is right. But I gave<br>them the secret to begin with. Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” says Ezarius. “But do you?”</p>
<p>“Only the venom of the Hectakron can destroy a totem. And<br>no mortal has ever procured it. Where do you think those<br>vials in your guarded care came from. I gave them to the<br>Heretics.”</p>
<p>Ezarius has no reply. Meecra’s evidence is enough to silence<br>his doubts. But Miguel has other worries.</p>
<p>“You’ve lied to us this whole time,” he says. “You were going<br>to take the totems for yourself. How could you so easily betray<br>us? “</p>
<p>“It did not worry me at first. But it has become a heavier burden.<br>If what Meecra says is true, maybe we can all get what<br>we want.”</p>
<p>“To destroy the gods?” asks Miguel.</p>
<p>Ezarius shakes his head. “To destroy them completely is to<br>become like them-cruel, destructive, heartless. I don’t want<br>to murder the gods, but I do expect them to live as equals.”</p>
<p>“And where does that leave us?” you ask.</p>
<p>In a sudden explosion of flame and smoke, Orfash roars,<br>his horns eternally burning, his eyes black with bloodlust.<br>“Shorme! Ohmlude! Where are you?”</p>
<p>Two more gods appear, one of them a short, curly-haired<br>woman with a fishing pole, the other a pale woman with obsidian<br>hair and ember eyes.</p>
<p>“What’s this about?” The short woman swashes the fishing<br>pole in his face. “I have no interest in your little feud with<br>Meecra.”</p>
<p>Orfash snorts. “Listen, Ohmlude, I’ve had my suspicions for<br>weeks, but now I’m certain. I can prove Meecra has been<br>scheming with mortals to betray the gods.” Shorme looks<br>intrigued, watching Meecra with deadly eagerness.</p>
<p>Ohmlude sighs. “Not this again. Why would she do something<br>like that? She’s as weak as the rest of us.”</p>
<p>Orfash stomps the ground with a heavy hoof, sending chunks<br>of rock and dirt in every direction. “Because she’s sided with<br>the mortals! She wants to be one of them. This Lukran she’s<br>working with is a Red Heretic!”</p>
<p>Ohmlude throws down the fishing pole and waddles up to<br>Ezarius, grabbing the edge of his coat and sniffing it. “Yes!<br>Orfash is right. This man has the smell of Hectakron venom on<br>him. It’s in one of his pockets!”</p>
<p>Shorme turns to Meecra, rage in her eyes. “Traitor! How dare<br>you work against us!”</p>
<p>Meecra nods solemnly. “Ezarius, now is the time. Give me the<br>totems. It’s the only way we’ll defeat them.”</p>
<p>Ezarius hesitates, looking from one god to another, then<br>throws a small pouch toward Meecra. Orfash yells and raises<br>an axe, Shorme shakes the ground with a slammed foot, and<br>Ohmlude picks up her fishing pole. Meecra gathers starlight<br>from the dusky sky and throws it at the other gods, who<br>charge at her.</p>

        <p>The gods collapse to the ground and a sulfuric cloud of smoke<br>appears. By the time it fades away, the defeated gods have<br>disappeared. Ezarius watches the last bit of smoke clear away,<br>wearing an expression of disbelief.</p>
<p>“We beat them!” says Jessie, poking the ground where the<br>gods had fallen with her baseball bat.</p>
<p>“Are they dead?” says Miguel, adjusting his glasses.</p>
<p>“No, not dead. They’re practically mortal now though,” says<br>Meecra. “But you must hurry! The portal is about to close!<br>Take your flying machine and go home.”</p>
<p>Ezarius looks at you with a half-smile tinged with melancholy.<br>“I’m going to miss you all.”</p>

        <p>By now, Eugene has the engines roaring. You’re the last one<br>in the plane, and when you climb inside and shut the door,<br>you’re greeted by hopeful and fearful faces.</p>
<p>The plane shudders as it releases its grip on the yellow grass<br>and soars toward the giant face in the mountain and the God<br>Eye. The portal flickers as you grow closer, sputtering with the<br>last moments of its life.</p>
<p>A sudden screech shakes the plane and pierces your ears like<br>a knife. The Helthark’s titanic shadow climbs up the mountain<br>face; you can see it above you. It swoops down, eager to dash<br>your plane against the cliffs.</p>
<p>Then an eerie song drifts over the mountain. The Helthark<br>slows, flapping its wings laboriously. It drifts to the ground<br>with a massive thump, asleep, just as you fly through the<br>swirling mass of the God Eye. Home waits for you on the<br>other side. You can feel your heart racing. Have you finally<br>returned?</p>
<p>Clouds surround the plane. In a gap ahead, something tall and<br>majestic and red stands above a glittering sea; the Golden<br>Gate Bridge welcomes you back.</p>
<p>“We’re home!” Jessie calls, and a cheer erupts in the back of<br>the plane.</p>
<p>Miguel radios the airstrip, and by the time you land, Ruby,<br>Ed’s daughter, is waiting with teary eyes. She runs to Ed and<br>throws her arms around his neck, then dashes to Miguel, covering<br>him with kisses. You jump onto your motorcycle, waving<br>at them, and race away with a burst of speed, already searching<br>for the next adventure.</p>
